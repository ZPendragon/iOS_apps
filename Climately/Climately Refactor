Climately Refactor

Currently, all code for Climately lives in one file: ViewController.swift

The goal is to apply MVC and/or MVVM to create a well architected app that follows the SOLID principles of OOD.

So, what does the app do?

The app opens and prompts the user to enter an address (city, state)

Pressing and holding 'Get Weather' sends a web request to WeatherUndergroud's API and populates several fields and displays an image. 

These fields include:
	- Summary
	- Temperature
	- Humidity
	- Precipitation
	- Wind
	- FeelsLike


Classes
	NetworkRequestManager
	WeatherReport
	WeatherImage
